# openAppApi
This is a repo for the weather app that connects with open weather API

The user can search for a city.  The cities current information will be displayed.
including the temperature, wind speed and humidity.

I used resources from the web MDN, tutors, classmates, Xpert Learning Assistant, and youtube.


I also included a screen shot of the app working in my local enviroment.
I dont know why but the JS errors I got whe trying to view through GitHub were that the API call was making an insecure fetch.
it was asking for HTTP instead of HTTPS...so I changed it to HTTPS but the functionality did not return. I am still trying to fix the problem.
